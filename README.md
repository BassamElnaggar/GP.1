# GP.1
OmniWheel controlled with encoder DC motor
first, construct the connection as in file#, it may change but you have to apply the change to your code 
using Arduino UNO or MEGA there is no difference for just one wheel but building the robot needs more pins so it's recommended to use MEGA
maybe the definition of the pins differs so make sure the definition and the connections are the same 
upload the code and click run 
read the value that comes and give various V values to see whether the code works or not
the code is detailed so following each line will lead to working properly
